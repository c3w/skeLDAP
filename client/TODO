. I need to write this part of the package, but thought I'd post some tips here in case you want to get started.

on the remote machine:
/etc/auto.master
	/home	ldap:myskeLDAPserver.com:ou=auto.home,dc=twitter,dc=org

copy the /etc/openldap/ldap.conf from your ldap server to client's /etc/ldap.conf after setting it up

modify /etc/nsswitch.conf so the lines look like this:

passwd:     files ldap
shadow:     files ldap
group:      files ldap


copy the /etc/pam.d/sshd file from the skeLDAP server and restart sshd

that's it! if NFS is set up correctly on the server, you should have automount /home dirs!

If you are having NFS trouble, try mounting /home manually to test and check both server and client logs

\/peace!
Chas.
